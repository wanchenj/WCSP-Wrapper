This is a wrapper for [WCSPLift](https://gitlab.com/xuphys/wcsp-solver/), a Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) Solver. The wrapper will provide a higher level format with which WCSPs can be input into the solver. The wrapper will translate files written in this higher level format into the format read by WCSPLift. It will then take the results from WCSPLift and translate them back into the format the user input in the first place.
